1. Replace light switches on dorm floor.  -- Need to pick up a couple of boxes of switches at Weber & Jones
2. Washing machine motor is hard starting. -- New motor backordered, Now to be delivered  5/13
3. Scriptorium clock. -- Timing mechanism needs adjustment. Again? It's pretty but doesn't keep the time. First fast then slow. Makes no sense!
4. Stage lights need adjusting for that Pagan play.
5. Display case for Armillary Sphere in Special Collections Room"
