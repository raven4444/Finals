What portends the end of our Age?

Response: 
Destiny and danger are still focused on the one, the renegade who is both brethren and betrayer. His true dream holds the balance: the lost stone of the Hierophant must be cleansed in Death's cauldron. His eye will trick the Trickster;  his shadow will stop the rust that blows like a wind from the past to melt the gilded apple. Beware when glyphs scuttle from the one final scratching that will shatter the Age; pen and blood will no longer contain them.

Instruction:
Seek not the end of things but beginnings."
