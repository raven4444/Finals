Subj.: Special Storage Passcode

I went up to the special storage safe and reset the five digit passcode for you. 

The attached mnemonic is much simpler than the last one. \"The pelagic argosy sights land\" was a big mistake. Even I had trouble with that! 

With the new one, as long as you remember how to tell the time and how to count, you should have no troubles.

By my personal hand,
