Who is the Crowned King of the Dead and what does he want?

Response: 
Rupert of Anharra led a rebellion against Olhm the Necromancer. After many long months and costly battles, the rebellion was put down and Rupert captured. 

To discourage future rebellions, Olhm boiled Rupert alive in a vat of lye, and then chopped off his head. Olhm next took the crown off of his own head, nailed it to Rupert's gleaming skull, and cursed Rupert's ghost to lead the defense of Anharra's heart until the crown is freed from Rupert's skull.
Instruction:
Holy, Holy, Holy. As a well aimed arrow flies to its target, you strike out the evil of the past. Holy, Holy, Holy."
