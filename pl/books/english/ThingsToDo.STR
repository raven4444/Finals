1. Pack for my ascension. What will I need once O. grants me wings? Will I want any of my old clothes? I think not! No, but my books, which of those?
2. Say goodbye to Tootsie. I wish I could take her along with me. But no, she wouldn't survive. I'll leave her caged.
3. Replace Garrett's graduation note. I'll offer to help with his exam and do it when Talia isn't looking. That milksop is so gullible, it should be easy.
4. Keep working on my aegis spell of protection. I'm close. I know I'm close. Something from birth and something from death. But what?"
