I know that some people will put a health rattle in a baby's burial chamber to keep the demons away from their child's remains.  Salka told me that she once saw the sparkly spirit of her poor baby playing happily near where she placed a rattle. So maybe it does help afterwards. Could it hurt?

Be strong. All my love, Nanna."
