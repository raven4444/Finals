What is the Maze of Anharra?

Response: 
Eghalt the Stark, the first  necromancer king of Anharra, built a modest catacomb in a system of caves beneath the Anharra Hills. Generations of Anaharran kings expanded on these catacombs, until the time of Ohlm. Ohlm was the last and greatest of the necromancer kings. He raised legions of dead workers from his slaughtered enemies and commanded them to build him a grand burial chamber at the heart of a labyrinthine necropolis. Some of these lost souls still scream through those corridors searching for their defiled remains. Ironically, Ohlm was never buried there. He vanished one day while working on a spell for eternal life. A lesser king now rests in that chamber.

Instruction: 
Prudence follows mute cries in unexpected flight, passing swiftly through the dark."
