by Sesil P. Curise

 This paper will attempt to present a Model Circulation System indicating a spectrum of functions and benefits. Four types of circulation systems will be discussed in an attempt to measure the capabilities of these systems against the Model and each other.
 Circulation systems can be categorized into four major groups based on the mode of operation: Manual, Semi- Assisted, Data Collection, and Assisted. Fry [1] was able to describe and compare 28 systems, most of which were variations of two basic types: the Newark Self-Charge System (originating around '07 and based on a book-card paradigm), and the Transaction Card System. Essentially these systems are unidimensional or single file systems. Modifications to these systems include the Gaylord System, the Demco System, and the Blauer System . . ."
