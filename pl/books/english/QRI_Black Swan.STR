Who was the Black Swan and what was his fate?

Response: 
 Prince Getty of Anharra had offended the Necromancer Olhm and so was cursed by Olhm to wear a black swan's feathers every day and human skin every night. While a swan or man he had no memories of his prior life, only a nebulous longing for something lost.
 One evening Sylvia the Huntress came across Prince Getty lying cold and naked at the edge of a lake. She was taken by his beauty and lay down beside him. At dawn, while she slept, he changed back into a swan and flew away. She searched long and hard for him that day, but without success. Just before evening she spied a black swan flying low over the water. She quickly notched an arrow and let it fly.
