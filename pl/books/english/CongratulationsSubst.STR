page_0: "Congratulations Garrett! By sucessfully retrieving and reading this scroll undetected, you have demonstrated that you are ready for final testing prior to your Delphanic initiation. 

This, your last assignment, is to find Ohlm's Grimoria Necromantica where we have hidden it in the Academy building, open it and copy out the Table of Contents. 

In order to pass this test, you may not be seen by anyone before you return here with the copied information. Good luck."
